# Blockbench Sources 📁

This folder holds the original `.bbmodel` files from Blockbench. Keep these as your source files for editing.

- Export to `.glb` and place in `../models/` for Godot import.
- Version your `.bbmodel` files (e.g., `dragon_v01.bbmodel`) to track changes.
- See `docs/blockbench_workflow.md` for export steps.

## Quick tips:
- Use consistent naming (snake_case or camelCase).
- Group related models in subfolders if needed (e.g., `mobs/`, `blocks/`).
